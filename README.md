# Dice-Roll-Probability-Simulator
 This Python project simulates rolling two dice multiple times to calculate the probability of each possible sum (2 to 12). Using the random module, the program generates dice rolls, counts frequencies, and computes probabilities, demonstrating basic probability concepts and random number generation.
